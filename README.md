# Autonomous Vehicles Stuff
All the algorithms and theory I need to know to work with autonomous vehicles. Topics include AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Fundamentals of Traffic Engineering, Optimization and more. I assume that you have mastered Python Programming Language. If you haven't, please refer to my AI repository over here: link [AI_Python_Louis](https://github.com/lotlouischoitslab/AI_Python_Louis)
