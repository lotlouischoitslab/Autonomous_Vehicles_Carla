# Autonomous Vehicles Stuff
All the algorithms and theory I need to know to work with autonomous vehicles. Topics include AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Fundamentals of Traffic Engineering, Optimization and more. I assume that you have mastered the Python Programming Language and you are comfortable with algorithms and data structures. If you haven't, please refer to my AI repository over here: [**AI_Python_Louis**](https://github.com/lotlouischoitslab/AI_Python_Louis)
